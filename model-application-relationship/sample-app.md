# Eba AI

## About the app

We are making an application whose job is to determine if a picture is or is not eba and then sort the eba images into a “cookbook of eba.” Suppose you just went on a trip with your eba-loving friend and took 3000 pictures of food. You want to surprise your friend with a cookbook of meals containing all the eba you encountered on your trip. However, you do not want to ruin the surprise by having your friend identify and sort the pictures. You also want to ensure this model works for others identifying eba and potentially growing the eba-finding community! How might we go about this?
